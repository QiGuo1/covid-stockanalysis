<b>Correlation between stock indices & coronavirus dataset</b><br>

From World Health Organization - On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new, we do not know how it affects people.

So everyday information on the affected people can give some interesting insights when it is made available to the broader data science community. Johns Hopkins University has made an excellent dashboard using the affected cases data.

To analysis the global economic impact of pandamic novel coronavirus, the task is to find correlation between stock indices and confirmed cases, cumutative cases and death due to the covid19 virus. The outcome of this analysis is a plot of correlation between stock indices and coronavirus dataset. The code is written in R-Programming Language.
